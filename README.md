## 💻 My Coding Journey  

### 🔙 How It All Started  
My **first line of code** was in **2014**, and it wasn’t just any code—it was a **prank virus!** 😆  
I wrote a **.bat file** that, when executed, would **continuously open CMD windows** in an infinite loop, making it nearly **impossible to shut down the PC**. I felt like a **hacker** back then! 😂 That small experiment **sparked my love for programming**.  

### 🛠️ From Curiosity to Mastery  
- Initially, I had no idea how to become a **real programmer**. I just **experimented** with different system scripts and commands.  
- In **2020, during the lockdown**, I stumbled upon **YouTube coding tutorials**, which opened a whole new world for me.  
- I started learning **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and eventually moved into **full-stack development**.  
- Over time, I **mastered multiple languages, built real-world applications**, and turned my **passion into a career**.  

### 🚀 Entrepreneurship & Beyond  
- After **gaining expertise** in web and app development, I co-founded my **first company**.  
- Today, in **2025, I’m the Co-Founder of 4 companies**, helping businesses grow through **technology-driven solutions**.  
- My team and I work on **software development, digital transformation, and innovative tech solutions**.  

🌍 **From a curious kid writing prank scripts to an entrepreneur building the future—my journey has been incredible, and I’m just getting started!** 💡🔥
